# Types of Bans

**Important: All bans now return the "This project is not running" screen. This page is for reference.**

Projects can get banned on Glitch for a number of reasons, here are a few:


### Violating Terms of Service. SKM

This error can mean at least two things, the first being that your project uses proxies and the second being that your project uses an always on NPM package.


### Unknown

This error can mean many things, an example being that your project used cryptocurrency mining scripts or phishing.

### 403 Forbidden

This is a very rare error that can happen when a project's name resembles another company's name or the project being involved phishing. Running `curl -I minecraft.glitch.me` returns 403 Forbidden.
